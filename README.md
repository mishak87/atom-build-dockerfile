# Dockerfile builder for Atom

**TL;DR** Open Dockerfile and press F9

Uses the [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) package to build Dockerfile from the Atom editor.  
Active (focused) editor filename must match `Dockerfile*` otherwise build option won't be available.

This package requires [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) to be installed.

NOTE: Due to a bug on Atom 1.7 Dockerfile build is available for all files.
